Unvedlievable
=============

Change google VED into human-readable value.

Some time ago, after reading a SEOmoz newsletter we found an interesting presentation about google referrer data. It seems that they've added a param involving where in the search result the user had click on.

This plugin allow you to automatically get the transcription of the Google VED parameter if the visit is coming from a google box click such as news, images, etc.

## How to

Include the script in your head (and don't forget to include jQuery):

    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/js/jquery.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="path/to/js/jquery.unvedliavable.js"></script>

Call the plugin when or where you want:

    <script>
    var ved = $.unvedlievable();
    </script>

Do your funky stuff with it!

## Other things

There are a couple of things you can do with this plugin:

$.unvedlievable(options);
